* Overview

Teaching material for protein design where multiple methods are introduced:
1) biophysical models are introduced (molecular mechanics force fields,
   molecular dynamics, thermodynamics of folding).
2) statistical techniques like singular value decomposition, or covariance
   models.
3) deep learning generative models such as variational autoencoders or graph
   neural networks.

The pedagogical aim is to introduce tools that are typically used in the context
of protein design, and to demonstrate their advantages and limits.
